        <h2 id="l3">lion</h2>
    <p>Adult male lions have the well-known mane only in adulthood, after several years of growth and strength-gaining. Young second-year males have a very scraggly appearance. Adult males out-size females by a small but significant amount. Lions are extremely powerful cats with enormous forelimbs that can break a cowâ€™s neck. Their massive build makes them largest of all cats except for the largest of the Siberian tigers.</p>
